I just started getting obsessed with the idea of creating a page that was simple and good for reading long bits of text. It's a work in progress, I"ll make a lot of tweaks. 

I'm testing with the history of the town I'm from, Warner Robins. I'm also thinking this could be a nice way to try out some visualizations too... 

Let me know if you know of other good book-like reading page styles!
